# The Infection - Project Zomboid Total Conversion Mod

A total conversion mod for Project Zomboid that transforms the zombie survival experience into a timed survival game with a dramatic "Infection Event" mechanic.

## Concept Overview

This mod fundamentally changes the Project Zomboid gameplay loop:

### Before the Infection
- **No zombies** spawn on the map initially
- Players can explore, build, and gather resources freely
- The world is peaceful but tension builds as the Infection Event approaches
- Time to prepare your defenses and fortify your base

### After the Infection Event
- **Everything outside your walls becomes hostile**
- All entities attempt to break through your defenses
- Waves of enemies bash against your barricades and walls
- Survival depends on the quality of your preparations

## Key Features

1. **Zero Initial Zombie Spawning**: Complete removal of zombies until the Infection Event triggers
2. **Timed Event System**: Configurable countdown to the Infection Event
3. **Wall Defense Mechanics**: Entities actively target and attack player-built structures
4. **Base Protection Zones**: Areas within player-defined walls remain safe
5. **Hostile Entity Spawning**: Mass spawn of aggressive entities when the event triggers
6. **Wave-Based Attacks**: Progressive difficulty with enemies attempting to breach defenses
